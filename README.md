This is a small javascript project where I set a single product priced at $1299 with 8GB of memory, 256GB of storage, and a free delivery charge. If anyone selects 16GB of memory, $180 will be added to the total cost as extra memory, and if they also select a 512GB SSD or 1TB SSD, $100 or $180 will be added to the total cost as extra storage, and if they also select the second option for the delivery charge, it will also add $20 to the total cost. And here is also a promo code: "stevekaku". Using this promo code, users can get 20% off their overall total cost, and this promo code is a one-time code.
